<h1>1. Preliminaries</h1>

<p>First of all, get the file <a href="http://www.esiee.fr/~coupriem/Graphestp1/GraphesTP1.tgz">GraphesTP1.tgz</a>
and uncompress it:</p>
<pre>    tar zxvf GraphesTP1.tgz
    rm GraphesTP1.tgz
    cd GraphesTP1; ls</pre>
This archive contains C programs for manipulating graphs. Documentation of
these programs can be found here:

<h2>1.1 First Graphs</h2>

<p></p>

<h3>1.1.1 Create and print a graph</h3>

<p>In an ordinary file, enter the data of an arbitrary graph as follows: </p>
<pre>&lt;number_of_vertices&gt; &lt;number_of_arcs&gt; 
arcs
&lt;initial_vertex&gt; &lt;final_vertex&gt;
&lt;initial_vertex&gt; &lt;final_vertex&gt;
...</pre>

<p>For instance (see the file k5.graph)&nbsp;: </p>
<pre>5 10
arcs
0 1
0 2
0 3
0 4
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 3
2 4
3 4</pre>

<p>Edit the files <b>exo111.c</b>, <b>exo112.c</b> and read them. Compile the
library: </p>
<pre>    make</pre>
then compile these two programs: 
<pre>    make exo111.exe
    make exo112.exe</pre>
and execute them: 
<pre>    ./exo111.exe k5.graph
    ./exo112.exe k5.graph</pre>

<p></p>

<p>The latter program creates a postscript file whose name extends the file
name of the given graph (eg here: k5.graph.eps). You can view the PostScript
file generated with <b>ghostview</b>, <b>kghostview</b> or <b>display</b>&nbsp;:
</p>
<pre>    display k5.graph.eps</pre>

<p></p>

<h3>1.1.2 Generate a random graph</h3>

<p>Edit the file <b>exo113.c</b>, read it, compile it, and execute it.
Visualize the results for several parameter values.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>1.2 First algorithms</h2>

<p>Before going any further, study the <a href="http://www.esiee.fr/~coupriem/Graphestp1/gamma.html">descrption of
the data structure</a> used to represent a graph by &#915; (its successors
map). Also remind to refer to the documentation of the source code,
including: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.esiee.fr/~coupriem/Graphesdoc/graphes_8h-source.html">source
    of the definition of the main data structures (graphe, cell...)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.esiee.fr/~coupriem/Graphesdoc/graph__basic_8c.html">description
    of the basic functions to handle graphs</a> (see in particular AjouteArc
    -meaning <em>AddArc</em> in French -, EstSuccesseur - meaning
    <em>IsSuccessor</em> in French)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.esiee.fr/~coupriem/Graphesdoc/graphaux_8c.html">description
    of the functions to handle lists (LIFO) and Boolean arrays</a> (see in
    particular CreeLifoVide - meaning <em>CreateEmptyLifo</em> in French-,
    EnsembleVide - meaning <em>EmptySet</em> in Frence)</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h3>1.2.1 Compute the symmetric of a graph</h3>

<p>Edit the file <b>exo121.c</b>, read it, compile it, and execute it. Study
the function <b>Sym</b>. Why isn't it efficient? What is the time complexity
of the algorithm?</p>

<p></p>

<h3>1.2.2 Measure of computation timesdu temps</h3>

<p>Edit the file <b>exo122.c</b>, read it, compile it, and execute it. Note
the computation times obtained for various sizes of graphs.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>1.2.3 Linear-time algorithm for computing the symmetric of a graph</h3>

<p>In the file <b>exo122.c</b>, change the function Sym to make the algorithm
linear (for any help, see the <a href="http://www.esiee.fr/~coustyj/EnglishMorphoGraph/L1.pdf">slides of the
first lecture</a>). Find below how to traverse a list of successors:</p>
<pre>  pcell p;
  ...
    /* for any successor y of x */
    for (p = g-&gt;gamma[x]; p != NULL; p = p-&gt;next) 
    {
      y = p-&gt;som;    
      ...</pre>

<p></p>

<p>Measure the computation time with the new version and compare. </p>

<h1>2. Friends</h1>

<p>Imagine a group of seven friends: Rachel, Monica, Ross, Chandler, Janice,
Joe, and Phoebe. They live in New York and plan to rent two cars to spend a
vacation in Florida. However, spending together the 18 hours that take the
trip can be problematic if the passengers of both vehicles are not carefully
selected.</p>

<p>In fact, you should know that</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rachel and Ross just broke up, it would not be wise to make them travel
    together. </li>
  <li>Joe has made proposals to Rachel, so there are tensions between him and
    Ross.</li>
  <li>But Phoebe seems to try to attract the attention of Joe, which cast a
    chill between her and Rachel. </li>
  <li>Chandler just took Joe's position as captain of the football team, the
    result is resentment.</li>
  <li>Monica and Chandler are jealous of Janice, because she is pregnant and
    they fail to have a baby.</li>
  <li>Finally, Monica thinks Joe is an idiot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formulate this problem in terms of graphs and give a solution for this
particular case.</p>

<p></p>

<h1>3. Bipartite graphs</h1>

<p>We say that a graph G = (E, &#915;) is <em>bipartite</em> if the set E of
its vertices can be partitioned into two subsets E<sub>1</sub> and
E<sub>2</sub> (ie, E<sub>1</sub> &#8746; E<sub>2</sub> = E and E<sub>1</sub>
&#8745; E<sub>2</sub> = &#8709;) such that an arc of G cannot link two
vertices of E<sub>1</sub>, and cannot link two vertices of E<sub>2</sub>
either. Consider for instance </p>

<p align="center"><img src="./MorphoGraphPS2_files/fig1.gif" width="475" border="0" height="106"></p>

<p>We see that G<sub>1</sub> is a bipartite graph with E<sub>1</sub> = {1, 4,
5} and E<sub>2</sub> = {2, 3}, and that G<sub>2</sub> is not a bipartite
graph. We can interpret the bi-partition of the graph vertices into two
subsets E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> as a ``coloring'' of the vertices
with two distinct colors (bi-coloring), one color for E<sub>1</sub> and the
other for E<sub>2</sub>. </p>

<p>In the following, for simplicity, we assume that G is connected.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>3.1 Algorithm</h2>

<p>Propose a linear time algorithm that indicates whether a given graph G is
bipartite or not, and if so, that returns a bi-coloring of G. Getting
inspired by the algorithm TRANS studied in course (see slide 21 of the <a href="http://www.esiee.fr/~coustyj/EnglishMorphoGraph/L3.pdf">lecture on
connectivity</a>) might be a successful idea.</p>

<h2>3.2 Implementation</h2>

<p>For the implementation of your algorithm you could learn from the
implementation of algorithm TRANS and of that of algorithm SCC, found in the
file <a href="http://www.esiee.fr/~coustyj/EnglishMorphoGraph/scc.c">scc.c</a>. It
will be probably easier to copy this code and modify it (you have to
understand it before that!).</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can use the field <strong>v_sommets</strong> of the <a href="http://www.esiee.fr/~coupriem/Graphesdoc/structgraphe.html">graphe</a>
structure to store the colors associated with the vertices, and the function
<a href="http://www.esiee.fr/~coupriem/Graphesdoc/graph__print_8c.html#a4">AfficheValeursSommets</a>
to display the result in text mode.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To graphically visualize the results of your algorithm, you may refer to
the program <strong>demo_couleurs.c</strong> located in your directory. This
program draws a graph whose vertices are named (by a string) and valued (by
the field v_sommets). These values, which are integers between 0 and 4, are
interpreted as colors (white, black, red, green and blue for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
respectively). The file <strong>demo_couleurs.graph</strong> contains an
example.</p>

<p>Test your program on several graphs that are bipartite or not, including
the one from section `` Friends.''</p>

<h1>4. Bonus (extra-work to be done after the practical session)</h1>

<p></p>

<h2>4.1 Property</h2>

<p>Prove that a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no cycle of odd
length. </p>

<p></p>

<h2>4.2 Detect odd cycles</h2>

<p>Given a non bipartite graph, propose and implement a method to detect and
display a cycle of odd length.</p>

<h2>4.3 Find bipartite graphs</h2>

<p>We can now imagine two strategies for finding a bipartite graph from a
graph that is not: the idea is to detect and remove cycles of odd length, by
deleting arcs, or by removing vertices. In our application "friends", the
first strategy consists of neglecting one or more animosity relations, the
second one is more radical because it excludes friends from the group.
Implement one of these two strategies.</p>
